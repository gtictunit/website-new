          God gave the Pioneer General Pastor some definite revelations and visions which led to the birth of the
          Ministry. He received accurate details of the date to start, the Name of the Ministry, the Organisational
          Structure, the Venue, and Names of the Trustees. <br><br>

          Right from the early years of GT as a church, the Pastor has been clearly focused about the type of Christians
          that should form the core of membership of the church. Such Christians, established on the solid foundation of
          the Word of God, living victorious holy lives, ready and willing at all times to be effective tools in the
          crafty hands of the Master and usable for His purpose as worthy vessels, tried and effective for the work of
          the Kingdom and prepared for heaven; were to form the core of membership of GT right from onset. <br><br>

          When Dr. Hans Adu-Dapaah, a Ghanaian and first ever Elder of the church separated himself to fast and pray
          unto the Lord sometime in 1991, the Lord told him specifically that GT is a Ministry with divine origin and
          divine destiny. He devoted his entire time, limited resources, skills and family to the service of the Lord,
          mainly in the area of assisting Pastor Obed in the day-to-day chores of running the Ministry physically and
          spiritually. He was a sterling model of such workers promised by God, who took his lead from the style of the
          Pastor, basically labouring tirelessly in the vineyard of the Lord, non-relenting in assuming tasks, no matter
          how menial.

                When Dr. Hans Adu-Dapaah, a Ghanaian and first ever Elder of the church separated himself to fast and
                pray unto the Lord sometime in 1991, the Lord told him specifically that GT is a Ministry with divine
                origin and divine destiny. He devoted his entire time, limited resources, skills and family to the

                Ministry physically and spiritually. He was a sterling model of such workers promised by God, who took
                his lead from the style of the Pastor, basically labouring tirelessly in the vineyard of the Lord,
                non-relenting in assuming tasks, no matter how menial. It was this leadership by example style that
                would pass down to successive leaders (of various cadres) through the years, such that tasks get done,
                no matter the social or academic status of who was involved. Dr. Hans, in defining his motivations for
                doing God’s work at the Glory Tabernacle at that time said: It was not easy.
                <br><br>

                The church started on a note of sacrifice, commitment, dedication and faith in God. We had the goodwill
                and favour from God and men. God opened a number of doors. All hands were on deck. For the first one and
                half years Pastor Obed never accepted any preaching appointment. We concentrated on building the
                capacity of the members of the church.
                <br><br>

                Little wonder then that God has since lifted up Dr. Hans to unimaginable heights of professional and
                spiritual endeavour since his return to his nation. The General Pastor states "Soon, I discovered that
                truly, workers have been divinely placed in positions already". Till today, much of what is done in the
                Ministry is taken up by willing members according to their skills and professions. The Lord keeps
                providing them as the need arises. There has not been a time we were not able to perform a task for lack
                of workmen. God has been true to His words.
                <br><br>

                The seriousness attached to attaining set goals was clearly evidenced by the type of programmes and the
                content of such programmes that were devised for the edification of members who submit to the grooming
                school of the Holy Spirit in GT, initially at her Agbowo base, and later at the present Bodija location.
