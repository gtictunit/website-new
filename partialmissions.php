                From 1990 to 1994 the tithe of tithes was shared among some mission agencies. The fund was sent to the headquarters of these agencies as general support to their work. However the church leadership soon thought that the field based missionaries needed the money more than their headquarters. From 1995 the mission fund was now used to support field based missionaries. It was also decided at that time that the support would be in phases of three years. <br><br>

                During this period the money was sent as monthly stipend to the missionaries. The missionaries were all nominated from and by several mission agencies. The income of the church was not much at that time. So we could only afford to pay each missionary five hundred Naira per month. It was regarded as partial support to augment whatever other support they were receiving from elsewhere, hence the name "Partial Missionary Sponsorship program". When PMSP entered its second phase (1998-2000), the income of the church had begun to increase. <br><br>

                Consequently, the stipend of the missionaries was increased to seven hundred and fifty Naira per month. The number of missionaries and mission agencies enjoying the support was increased by more than 100%. We also began sponsorship of missionary children. In subsequent phases, the number of missionaries and missionary children benefiting from the scheme further increased. The table below shows GT's progressive involvement in Missions.
