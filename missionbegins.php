                The Glory Tabernacle Ministry was established on 7th January, 1990. It is a single congregation Ministry which has been involved in missions work from its inception. One very unique experience the ministry had from the beginning was that the Lord inspired the leadership of the Ministry on the need to tithe all the tithes and offerings. The tithe of tithes was designated for mission support. In this way, the fund for mission support was secured. This was the direct outcome of the favorable disposition of the Pastor to missions. <br><br>
                <p>The missions support has had intensive growth all glory be to God and has now dedicated itself by establishing different programs and different teams and other activities such as <b>
                Annual Mission, Awareness Week, Missions Luncheon (for mobilizing Pastors), Missionary Children Carnival
                </b> and so on
